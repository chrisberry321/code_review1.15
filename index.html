                          <p>With an expansive 40 miles of National Seashore, Cape Cod is one of New England's premier beach destinations. But there's more to do here than sun and sand: Thriving summer theater scenes draw out the best of Broadway while miles-long bike trails and well-protected wildlife showcases the one-of-a-kind Cape Cod environs. And don't forget to visit lively Provincetown where a lesser-known chapter of the Thanksgiving Pilgrim story waits to be uncovered.</p>

                          <h1>Palm Springs</h1>
                          <p>Palm Springs used to be all about the bling.
                            Once Hollywood’s favourite playground with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe popping in regularly to party, it’s now dusted off the faded glamour to emerge in the bright Californian sunshine as a hip indie hangout for Coachella refugees, a magnet for architecture fans, an escape for nature lovers and a laid-back gay destination.
                            Despite its many personalities, it’s a relaxed and quirky desert town with heaps of playful charm.
                            So many beautiful houses So many beautiful houses It’s got architecture  Not only was it a mecca for Hollywood stars but celebrities of the architecture world also created some stunning buildings in Palm Springs including Donald Wexler, E. Stewart Williams and John Lautner. Taking inspiration from the Bauhaus movement, they followed modernist principles coming up with sleek designs that work with the natural landscape around it. No ugly office blocks here. Even the local KFC has its own offbeat personality.</p>
                            <p>You can take a tour with a knowledgeable guide to sigh over Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest holiday home purchase, marvel at Liberace’s home and check out the house where Elvis and his new bride Priscilla spent their first year of marriage.</p>

                            <p><em>It’s got nature</em>A short drive out of Palm Springs is Indian Canyons, a gorgeous reservation. There’s a whole range of walks you can do but the best way to take in the stunning views of the desert is by horseback.</p>

                          <h1>Aspen</h1>
                          <p>If there's one thing Aspen's known for, it's skiing. This tiny mountain town is surrounded by four monumental ski areas: Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk (a favorite among beginners) and the ever-popular Snowmass Ski Resort. The luster isn't lost when the snow melts, however. The Rockies offer some spectacular hiking spots like the Maroon Bell peaks, with jaw dropping vistas. If you're looking for a more relaxing getaway, treat yourself to a massage at an area spa or try a therapeutic soak in the Glenwood Springs natural hot springs.</p>
